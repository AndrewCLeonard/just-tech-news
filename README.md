| Set up the project.                        | You’ll build off of the previous project by creating new GitHub issues and adding a style sheet. |
| Set up the template engine.                | You’ll install Handlebars and configure Express to use it as its template engine.                |
| Create the homepage template.              | You’ll create a Handlebars template for the homepage, populated with dummy data.                 |
| Populate the template with Sequelize data. | You’ll use a previously defined Sequelize query to populate the homepage with real data.         |

-   Models: the core data of your app
-   Views: the UI components, such as your HTML layouts
-   Controllers: the link between your models and views
